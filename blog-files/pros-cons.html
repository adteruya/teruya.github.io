      Citizen journalism, like many aspects of life, has its pros and cons.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the positive side, citizen journalism has allowed the public a platform
      where they can fact check the news given out to them by traditional news
      outlets. This provides multiple perspectives towards a single topic, which
       can lead to constructive discussions among the public. Citizen journalism
       also gives smaller communities a voice and a platform accessible to the
       entire world. This accessibility to foreign information connects the world
       and raises awareness of issues in different communities. And most importantly,
       citizen journalism allows for the rapid spread of information regarding crises.
       A good example of this in practice is the Boston Marathon Bombings in 2013: a
       soon as news broke out, citizen journalists took to social media to search for
        the culprits of the crime.
    </p>
    <p>
      With everything good there is always the bad, and citizen journalism is
      not without its faults. For one, citizen journalists may generate their
      reports with a bias towards a certain perspective. This and a lack of
      training in fact checking can lead to the spread of false information to
      the rest of the world. A domino affect can be seen in situations like this,
      where the false news spread by citizens can be used by professionals,
      ultimately spreading the incorrect news to an even larger audience.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rise of citizen journalism along side social media has certainly
      caused both positive and negative situations. Now more than ever, it is
      imperative that people keep a level of skepticism when reading the news in
      order to spot and prevent the spread of false information.
