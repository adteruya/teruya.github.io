      News nowadays, both local and global, is so easily reported and spread to millions of
      people across the world; a large factor contributing to that being the internet. As a
      result of this change, a new form of journalism has appeared along side the usual
      mainstream versions: citizen journalism.

      Now you may be asking: what is citizen journalism? At the very basic level, citizen
      journalism is news that is researched and/or reported by the public (people who have no
      connection to mainstream news outlets) and spread to others via social media and the internet.
      The type of reports that can be seen from citizen journalists range from highly researched
      articles posted on blogs or social media sites to videos taken at an event or sudden calamity.
      The wide variety of reports that citizen journalists put out into the internet contribute to the
      rapid spread of information, and are often the main reason why so many events in the world hit
      the trending page within a matter of minutes. Traditional news outlets have also evolved in response
      to the rise of citizen journalism, and often utilize the information, photos and videos put
      out by the public in their own reports.

      Citizen journalism has certainly contributed to the spread of information across the country and
      world, but does it bring more harm than good? More importantly, is the content being spread
      accurate and fact checked? In an age where news has become so casual, misinterpreted information
      is common place, creating situations with very drastic effects on society. (TO BE CONTINUED IN NEXT POST)
