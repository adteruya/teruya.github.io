        <h3>626 Night Market Poster</h3>
        <p>
          This piece was part of a class project where we were tasked with
          creating a poster of an event of our choosing. One of the difficulites
          that came with creating this design was maintaining the stylistic choices
          of the event, while also incorporating your own style. To solve this
          problem, I looked at different posters that the Night Market had created
          for past events to get an idea of what their color schemes, font, and
          image choices were. From there, I did many iterations of my poster using
          both Adobe Illustrator and Adobe Photoshop, until I finally decided on
          the design that best represented the event.

        <h3>Georgia O'Keeffe Poster</h3>
        <p>
          The Georgia O'Keeffe poster was another class project, with the
          assignment being to create a poster that celebrates an influential
          person in the arts or sciences. I chose Georgia O'Keeffe because I have
          great respect for much of her paintings. For the poster design, I
          decided to exemplify her large art pieces by scaling them to be about
          (or larger) than the photo bust. Additionally, because one of her art
          mediums was watercolor, I used a special brush to give the edge of the
          paintings a fading effect.

        <h3>Paul Rand Book Design</h3>
        <p>
          This book design project was a full re-design of Paul Rand's "Design and
          the Play Instinct." We were all given the text within the book, as
          well as the photos that accompanied them. A big issue that I ran into while
          creating this design was the orientation of the text in relation to the
          photos. I found it hard to create page spreads that effectively showcased
          the images, while not overshadowing the text content. However, I eventually
          found an effective way of representing all the required data after multiple
          iterations creatied in Adobe InDesign.

        <h3>Graphite Cup</h3>
        <p>
          For this project, we were tasked with sketching and shading an enlarged photo of
          an object of our choice. We needed to use all the sketching techniques learned
          in class: stippling, cross-hatching, etc. A major hurdle for me when creating
          this project was using the right technique to effectively show the details of the
          cup. This took mutliple re-dos due to the difficulty of this project.

        <h3>Still-Life Ink and Watercolor</h3>
        <p>
          Using both pen and watercolor, we were tasked with illustrating a still life piece.
          The piece we created on our own, and it needed to have a woven basket, rocks, a blanket,
          a round object, leaves, and a feather. One of the difficult parts of this project was
          collecting the materials and placing them in a stylistic way. I had to do multiple different
          orientation of the objects before finally deciding on one.

        <h3>Pen Skeleton</h3>
        <p>
          For this project, we were given a print out of a skeleton and were tasked with
          replecating it on a larger scale. A major issue when drawing this was getting
          the size and proportions of the skeleton correct. The hands ended up being a little
          bit to big in the final design, but I'm proud of how the details came out in the end.
